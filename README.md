# Twitter Temperance

A chrome extension that makes you tweet before you can view your feed. Here's how you get set up:
1. Go to [this url](https://github.com/pranavnt/twitter-temperance/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and download the zip file
2. Unzip the file
3. Go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) and turn on developer mode
4. Press "Load unpacked", and select the folder that you just downloaded
5. The extension is now installed!

If there's anything that you'd like to add, feel free to create a GitHub issue or submit a PR :)
